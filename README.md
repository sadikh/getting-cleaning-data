* Clone this repo (or download the `run_analysis.R` file).
* Download the data from `https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip`.
* Unzip the zip file.
* Run `run_analysis.R`. Make sure it is in the same directory as the data.

# Output

The script produces a tidy data set `average_data.txt` with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
